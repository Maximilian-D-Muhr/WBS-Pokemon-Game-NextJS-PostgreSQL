# WBS Pokemon Game

A Pokemon Battle Game built as a group project at WBS Coding School.

## Project Goal

Build an interactive Pokemon game with the following features:
- Browse and select Pokemon from the PokeAPI
- Build your own roster (team)
- Battle against random opponents
- Compare scores on the leaderboard

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Next.js | 16.x | React Framework with App Router |
| React | 19.x | UI Library |
| TypeScript | 5.x | Type Safety |
| Tailwind CSS | 4.x | Styling |
| Zod | 4.x | Runtime Validation |
| Neon | - | PostgreSQL Database |

## Security Features

This project implements advanced security measures to protect against common web attacks:

### Honeypot System ("Hall of Shame")

A proactive security concept that detects and logs malicious activity:

| Protection | Method |
|------------|--------|
| SQL Injection | Parameterized queries + pattern detection |
| XSS Attacks | React auto-escaping + input sanitization |
| Score Manipulation | Server-side validation (max score limits) |
| Type Injection | Zod schema validation |
| Overflow Attacks | Negative number detection |

**How it works:** Instead of simply blocking attacks, suspicious submissions are logged to a public "Hall of Shame" table while returning fake success responses. This honeypot approach catches attackers who believe their exploit worked.

> 🔒 **Security Audit made possible with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)**
>
> *Advanced security architecture and honeypot implementation concept by Max and Waqar. Implementation realized and end-to-end testing co-authored and validated by Claude Opus 4.5.*
